# Everyday DSA

## Overview

Welcome to my Everyday DSA repository! This is where I document my journey of solving data structure, algorithm, and system design problems daily using C++, Golang, and Python. The goal is to enhance my problem-solving skills and become proficient in these three programming languages.

## Introduction

This repository is a personal project to improve my coding skills and gain a deeper understanding of data structures, algorithms, and system design concepts. By solving a problem daily, I aim to reinforce my knowledge and explore the nuances of different programming languages.

## Languages

- Cplusplus
- Golang
- Python

## Structure

The repository is organized by language and each language directory contains subdirectories for each day's challenge. The structure is as follows:

```
|-- Cpluplus
|   |-- Day1
|   |-- Day2
|   |-- ...
|-- Golang
|   |-- Day1
|   |-- Day2
|   |-- ...
|-- Python
|   |-- Day1
|   |-- Day2
|   |-- ...
```

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/daily-coding-challenge.git
```

2. Navigate to the directory of the language you want to explore:

> cpp
    ```bash
    cd everydaydsa/cplusplus
    ```
> go
    ```bash
    cd everydaydsa/golang
    ```

> python
    ```bash
    cd everydaydsa/python
    ```

3. Browse through the challenges, pick a day, and explore the solution.

4. Feel free to contribute your solutions, improvements, or suggest new problems!
